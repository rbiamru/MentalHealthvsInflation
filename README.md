# Literature Review
## Introduction
Economic inflation is a critical factor that affects various aspects of society, including mental health. The relationship between economic inflation and mental health has been explored in numerous studies, highlighting the significant impact of financial stress on psychological well-being.

## Financial Stress and Mental Health
Several studies have shown that economic inflation leads to increased financial stress, which in turn affects mental health. According to a study by the American Psychological Association (APA), financial stress is one of the leading causes of anxiety and depression. The study found that individuals experiencing financial difficulties are more likely to report symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.

## Basic Needs Insecurity
Inflation can make it difficult for individuals to afford basic necessities such as food, housing, and healthcare. This insecurity can exacerbate symptoms of anxiety and depression. A study published in the Journal of Health Economics found that individuals who struggle to meet their basic needs are more likely to experience psychological distress.

## Impact on Vulnerable Populations
Vulnerable populations, such as low-income families and individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions, are disproportionately affected by economic inflation. Research by the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that these groups are more likely to experience severe mental health issues during periods of economic instability.

## Coping Strategies
Various coping strategies can help mitigate the mental health impacts of economic inflation. Financial planning, community support, and access to mental health resources are essential for individuals facing financial stress. A study by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) highlights the importance of these strategies in promoting mental well-being during economic downturns.

# Thematic Report
## Theme 1: Financial Stress
Economic inflation leads to increased financial stress, which significantly impacts mental health. Individuals experiencing financial difficulties report higher levels of anxiety, depression, and psychological distress. Financial stress is a critical factor that needs to be addressed to improve mental health outcomes.

## Theme 2: Basic Needs Insecurity
Inflation affects individuals' ability to afford basic necessities, leading to increased insecurity and psychological distress. Ensuring access to affordable housing, food, and healthcare is essential for mitigating the mental health impacts of economic inflation.

## Theme 3: Vulnerable Populations
Vulnerable populations, including low-income families and individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions, are disproportionately affected by economic inflation. Targeted interventions and support systems are necessary to address the unique challenges faced by these groups.

## Theme 4: Coping Strategies
Effective coping strategies, such as financial planning, community support, and access to mental health resources, are crucial for mitigating the mental health impacts of economic inflation. Promoting these strategies can help individuals manage financial stress and improve their overall well-being.
